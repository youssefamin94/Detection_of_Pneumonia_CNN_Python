# Detection-of-Pneumonia-CNN-Python

Developed a pneumonia detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The aim of this project is to use deep learning techniques to identify pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images.

I built a CNN architecture from scratch that included multiple convolutional layers, pooling and activation layers and the final layers included fully connected layers and a sigmoid activation function for classification.
